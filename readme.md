This course aims to get you started on the path toward JavaScript mastery. You will learn how to: create code that can make basic decisions; create efficient debugging techniques with browser developer tools; access and modify HTML elements and CSS styles on a page; and use JavaScript to communicate with a server. This course will also introduce you to the rapidly growing world of JavaScript Libraries, and you'll get a chance to create a simple application with Backbone.js.
